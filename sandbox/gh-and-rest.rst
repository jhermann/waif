Section 1
---------

A link to `Section 2`_ below.
Also `with alternate text <#section-2>`_ (requires constructing the anchor, which isn't too nice).

These work in *Sphinx*, but not on GH:

* A labeled :ref:`section-two` link?
* Or `section-two`_?
* Possibly needing `explicit text + label <section-two>`_?
